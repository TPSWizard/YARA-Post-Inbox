YARA Rules for PhishER - Under construction
===================================

YARA rules are text files with a very basic, yet powerful, syntax. These rules contain three parts:

Each rule in YARA starts with the keyword rule followed by a rule identifier. Identifiers must follow the same lexical conventions of the C programming language, they can contain any alphanumeric character and the underscore character, but the first character cannot be a digit. Rule identifiers are case sensitive and cannot exceed 128 characters. The following keywords are reserved and cannot be used as an identifier:

Meta: Background information regarding rule - Not processed

Strings: Pieces of information being searched for in our target email.

Conditions: Defines the condition for matching. It can be just matching one or several strings. (Are my strings "true?)   
    

Writing YARA Rules:
================================

Each rule in YARA starts with the keyword ``rule`` followed by a rule
identifier. Identifiers must follow the same lexical conventions of the C
programming language, they can contain any alphanumeric character and the
underscore character, but the first character cannot be a digit. Rule
identifiers are case sensitive and cannot exceed 128 characters. The following
keywords are reserved and cannot be used as an identifier:
